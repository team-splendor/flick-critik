## Final Thoughts
Looking back at the time we spent working on the project, we had a successful run. We had a limited amount of time given that this was a summer class but yet we were still able to come together as a team and pull through to put out a final product. Some challenges we had were learning how to follow dynamic analysis for one and another was probably figuring out how to split up the work and resolve merge conflicts when they occurred. We are all proud of how well we worked together to put out our product even in the shortened amount of time. The app itself is not fully complete as there are still features that can be added to imporive it but the basic functionality is there and we are satisfied with our product as a whole. We have all learned a lot throughout the process of making our app and we are glad we can look back at it now and see the final product in a positive light.
